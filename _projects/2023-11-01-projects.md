Description: 

Parsed extensive JSON files comprising thousands of tweets extracted from the Runkeeper app, categorizing them based on activity types. Subsequently, trends within the data were identified, and visual representations were generated using the Vega-Lite framework. Additionally, a dynamic and live-updating search table was implemented, enabling users to filter tweets based on specific keywords and seamlessly interact with the data to extract relevant insights.
