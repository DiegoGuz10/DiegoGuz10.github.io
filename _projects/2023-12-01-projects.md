Description: Utilized Angular to seamlessly integrate Spotify's API into an HTML file, facilitating the display of comprehensive information related to albums, songs, and artists. The implementation involved parsing through JSON files to extract the desired data and culminated in the creation of a user-friendly interface. This interface featured a robust search functionality that interacted with Spotify's API, enabling users to access and view information about music albums, songs, and artists.
