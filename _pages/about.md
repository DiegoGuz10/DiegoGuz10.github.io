<!-- I am currently a third-year Informatics student at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), specializing in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and minoring in Information and Computer Science. Alongside my studies, I am actively involved in undergraduate research, with particular interests in:

1.
Information Retrieval and Visualization

2.
Human-Computer Interaction 

3.
Database Systems

4.
Content-Rich User Interfaces  

At the moment, I am conducting research on how Large Language Models can augment reflective thematic analysis for semi-structured interviews. As a result, I am working under the Social & Technological Action Research (STAR) Lab. It is ran by the Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Dean of the Graduate Division at UC Irvine, Dean Gillian Hayes.  -->

I am currently a rising senior Informatics student at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), specializing in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and minoring in Information and Computer Science. Alongside my studies, I am actively involved in undergraduate research at the [Social & Technological Action Research (STAR) Lab](https://www.star-uci.org/), advised [Dr.Jesus Armando Beltran Verdugo][https://www.linkedin.com/in/abeltran23/] by [Dr. Gillian Hayes](https://www.gillianhayes.com/). Recently, I completed a stint as a Visiting Undergraduate Researcher at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) at the [EPIC Data Lab](https://epic.berkeley.edu/) advised by [Dr. Yiming Lin](https://yiminglin18.com/) and [Dr. Aditya Parameswaran](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~adityagp/). 

My research interest lies in empowering individuals with disabilities by developing accessible and interactive technologies that help them overcome physical and cognitive barriers in their daily lives. I approach this goal through various aspects of Computer Science, particularly focusing on HCI, user interfaces and information retrieval.
