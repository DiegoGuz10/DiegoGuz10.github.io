<!-- I am currently a third-year Informatics student at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), specializing in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and minoring in Information and Computer Science. Alongside my studies, I am actively involved in undergraduate research, with particular interests in:

1.
Information Retrieval and Visualization

2.
Human-Computer Interaction 

3.
Database Systems

4.
Content-Rich User Interfaces  

At the moment, I am conducting research on how Large Language Models can augment reflective thematic analysis for semi-structured interviews. As a result, I am working under the Social & Technological Action Research (STAR) Lab. It is ran by the Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Dean of the Graduate Division at UC Irvine, Dean Gillian Hayes.  -->

I am currently a rising senior Informatics student at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), specializing in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and minoring in Information and Computer Science. Alongside my studies, I am actively involved in undergraduate research at the Social & Technological Action Research (STAR) Lab, led by Dr. Gillian Hayes. In addition to my research at UCI, I am currently a Visiting Undergraduate Researcher at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) at the EPIC Data lab. Broadly, my research interests include information retrieval and visualization, human-computer interaction, database systems, and content-rich user interfaces.
