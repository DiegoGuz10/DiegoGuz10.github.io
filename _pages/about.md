Currently, I am a 3rd year Informatics student at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) specializing in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I am also an undergraduate researcher. Some of my research interests include

1.
Infomartion Retrieval and Visualization

2.
Human-Computer Interaction 

3.
Content-Rich User Interfaces.   

Presently, I am conducting research on how Large Language Models can augment reflective thematic analysis for semi-structured interviews. As a result, I am working under the Social & Technological Action Research (STAR) Lab. It is ran by the Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Dean of the Graduate Division at UC Irvine, Dean Gillian Hayes.
