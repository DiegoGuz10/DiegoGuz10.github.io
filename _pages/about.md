I am currently a third-year Informatics student at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), specializing in human-computer interaction (HCI) and minoring in Information and Computer Science. Alongside my studies, I am actively involved in undergraduate research, with particular interests in:

1.
Information Retrieval and Visualization

2.
Human-Computer Interaction 

3.
Content-Rich User Interfaces   

At the moment, I am conducting research on how Large Language Models can augment reflective thematic analysis for semi-structured interviews. As a result, I am working under the Social & Technological Action Research (STAR) Lab. It is ran by the Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Dean of the Graduate Division at UC Irvine, Dean Gillian Hayes.
